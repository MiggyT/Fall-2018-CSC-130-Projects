# Data Structures Algorithim Analysis CSC130
This repository contains all the major projects that I have completed for my computer science course CSC 130. Note that there are fewer projects here becuase the Northern California fire's that occurred a couple years ago affected class assignments. This class gave me an understanding of complex data stuctures in Java and taught me how to analyze algorithms. Grade recieved: A
